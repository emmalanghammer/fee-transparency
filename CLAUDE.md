# Fee Transparency prototype

A Rent Manager Express pricing-setup / fee-transparency prototype. Everything lives in
`index.html` — one `class Component extends DCLogic`, `screenHTML()` template strings, and a
delegated `data-act` / `data-arg` dispatcher in `onClick`. `support.js` and `ds/` are the
Design Components runtime and the RMX design system; don't edit them.

## Branches

- **`experiment`** is where the work happens, and it is what GitHub Pages serves.
- **`main`** is a frozen snapshot of the prototype as it stood on 2026-09-17, kept so the
  version demoed up to then can still be read. Don't commit to it, and don't merge
  `experiment` into it, unless the user asks.

## Deploying

`git push origin experiment` triggers the Actions workflow. Poll it with
`gh run view <id> --json status,conclusion` until it says `completed success`, then the change
is live at <https://emmalanghammer.github.io/fee-transparency/>.

**Do not republish the artifact.** <https://claude.ai/artifact/JCtc82KKhtuQJ1eEDfiQdj> is
frozen at Version 29, which matches `main`. It is the shareable record of that snapshot, so
pushing `experiment` work into it would destroy the thing it exists to preserve. Publish an
artifact again only when the user asks — and if they want the experiment shared, ask whether
it should be a **new** artifact rather than this one.

## Things that will bite

- **Vendored runtime.** `support.js` loads React, ReactDOM and Babel from unpkg by default. A
  published artifact blocks outbound requests, so `index.html`'s head sets `window.__resources`
  to the copies in `vendor/`. If you touch that map or those files, reload the page and confirm
  `performance.getEntriesByType('resource')` shows nothing off-origin except Google Fonts,
  which is the one host an artifact permits.
- **No leading underscores in published paths.** The artifact service reserves them — that is
  why the design system lives in `ds/` rather than `_ds/`.
- **Check the syntax before you deploy.** The whole app is one `<script>` block inside a
  template-literal-heavy file; a stray backtick breaks the page silently. Parse each `<script>`
  with `new Function` and fail on the first error.
- **Edit by exact-string replacement, with an assert on the match count.** Several blocks in
  `index.html` are near-identical (the charge callout appears three times, `Transactions` tiles
  twice); a loose match patches the wrong one.
- **Re-rendering wipes form state.** Live form updates go through the DOM-only helpers
  (`window.__attrCheck`, `__mitsRecheck`, `__nameMode`, `__exclSync` and friends) rather than
  `setState`.

## The model

Every property's charges are readable in one place — the **Charges** overlay on the property —
from the first look. Nothing is migrated or turned on: `profileRows(prop)` falls back to
`defaultCharges(prop)`, which reads the charges the property already runs with their marketing
details blank. `profileFees[prop]` only exists once someone edits something.

A charge keeps the level it was written at (Property, Unit Type, Unit, Other Rentable Item — the
level's stored value is still the string `ORI`, only what a user reads changed) and is editable from
**either** that level's own page or the property's Charges — the unit and unit-type Recurring
Charges tiles are full add / edit / remove, not a read-only mirror. The property's General tab
carries no Recurring Charges tile, because Charges opens over that same page.

There is no centralization step, no `profStatus`, and the word "centralize" appears nowhere. The
only journey left is: fill in each charge's marketing details → convert to Fee Transparency
(which only applies to a property that lists online on a provider carrying complete pricing).
`ftStatus` has four rungs: Incomplete Charges → Ready to Convert → Needs Attention → Complete.

## Marketing defaults by charge type

`state.mktDef` maps a charge type code to the marketing details a charge of that type starts
with. It is set **on the charge type itself** — a **Marketing Details** tile in the Charge Type Details
overlay (`ctDetailHTML`, ids `ctd-mkt-*`, saved by `ctSave`), carrying Name, Charge Category,
Marketing Description, Charge Requirement, Charge Schedule, Fee Due and Refundable. The entry
follows the code if the code is renamed. **The Marketing Center has no Charge Type Defaults
button, tab or overlay** — that was the old home and it is gone.

`saveFee` runs `mktDefFill` on a charge being **created**, so it starts filled in; editing an
existing charge never re-applies them.

**How far a default reaches is asked, not assumed.** When `ctSave` sees the marketing details
changed *and* charges of that type already exist, it holds them in `state.mktDefDraft` and raises
`mktDefAskHTML()` — "How do you want to apply these marketing details?" — with three answers,
applied by `mktDefApply`:

- `new` — save the defaults and touch nothing that exists.
- `blank` — fill the fields still empty on existing charges (`mktDefFill`, no force). The default.
- `all` — overwrite these fields on every charge of the types **this save changed**
  (`mktDefChanged`), values someone typed included (`mktDefFill(..., true)`).

`mktDefApply` is what commits `state.mktDef`, not `ctSave` — otherwise `mktDefChanged` would be
diffing against the values it just wrote. The dialog's Cancel returns to the form with everything
typed still on it, which is why the tile renders from `mktDefDraft` when one exists rather than
from `state.mktDef`. A charge type with no charges yet skips the dialog and just saves.

## The Marketing Center

`view: 'feetrans'` is the **Marketing Center** — one page for everything that decides what a
listing advertises. It matches Figma `3482:73909`: `marketingCenterBody()` stacks `mcTabs()` over
`mcScoreboard()` over one white panel — tabs and cards sit on the page background, not inside the
panel. Three tabs, no count pills; the label and the `mcTab` key are not the same thing:

- **Overview** — `feeTransBody()`, the property register. The default tab.
- **Property Marketing Setup** (key `Properties`) — `mcPropsPanel()`, a master–detail (below).
- **Listings** — `listingsBody()`, one row per unit floor plan. The nav's Listings entry now
  lands here (`mcTab: 'Listings'`); there is no separate listings view.

The Overview register's columns are **Property, Marketed, Listing Ready Charges, Listings, Price
Shown, Next Steps**. Listing Ready Charges is a fraction with a dot that goes green only when it
is whole; Marketed reads ILS feed / MH Village / Not marketed; Price Shown reads Total monthly /
Rent only / Not carried. There is no Status column and no Group by Status.

**Charge Type Defaults is not a tab.** It is a portfolio-wide setting, so it is a button beside
the tabs (`mktDefOpen`) that opens `mktDefOvHTML()` over the page.

`mcPropsPanel()` is a 290px list on the left and one pane on the right. The list's first row is
**All Properties**; every other row is a property with a status dot and a one-line summary.
Selecting a row runs `mcPick` (empty arg = All Properties), which also moves `state.property`,
so everything the detail renders reads the right property.

- **All Properties** — `feeTransBody()`, the register that says how everyone is doing.
- **a property** — `mcPropDetail()`: `mktSetupBody()` on its **General** tab, plus an
  Advanced / Save / Cancel footer. Cancel goes back to All Properties.

In the register a row, and the property name in it, go to the **property page** (`navProperty`)
— it is a list of properties, so it behaves like one. `mcOpenProp` is the marketing move, and it
is left on the **Next Step** link and the kebab's Marketing Setup item: it lands on the Marketing
Center with that property selected, on the Pricing tab when charges are still missing details.
That is the only route that opens on Pricing; browsing the left list always opens on General.

`mcScoreboard()` renders on **Overview only** — the other two tabs are a working surface, not a
place to read portfolio numbers. It is four equal cards: Properties being marketed, Total price advertised, Charges
missing marketing details, Listings that have errors. The last two carry a coloured left spine —
amber and red — and are the only two that do anything: `mcShort` filters the Overview register to
`short`, `mcErrs` opens Listings with errors-only ticked. Each tints on hover and stays tinted
while the page below is showing what it counted; clicking a lit card takes the filter back off.

## Where marketing details live

`mktSetupBody()` is the Marketing Setup itself, and matches Figma `3457:41815`: the property
header strip, the General / Pricing tabs, and the selected tab. The strip and the tabs are a
fixed band; only the tab's own content scrolls, so the property you are on and the tab you are on
never leave the screen. The Marketing Center renders it
inline; the property page's own overlay (`mktSetupHTML`) wraps the same markup in chrome. One
source, so the two cannot drift.

**Marketing Setup › Pricing** (`mktPricingBody`, saved by `mktPricingSave`) is the only place a
charge's marketing details are edited, and it matches Figma `3490:98757` / `3493:102283`: the
same two registers the Charges overlay shows — Recurring and One-Time — with a **Listing Ready**
column and a chevron that expands the row into its Marketing Details. A banner above says how
many charges are still short and why that blocks converting.

The expanded panel carries the missing fields as amber chips, then Name / Marketing Description /
Charge Category over Charge Requirement / Fee Due / Charge Schedule, then the Include-on-listings
switch. Neither the banner nor the fill-in line is rendered when there is nothing outstanding —
the Listing Ready column already reads green, and a line saying so twice is noise. **Charge Category is required on the charge**, not inherited: the charge type's category is
a hint in the field's tooltip, and `mitsMissing` reads `r.listing.category` rather than the
resolved one, so a charge isn't listing ready until someone chooses it here. A field with nothing entered opens on its
charge type's default from `state.mktDef`.

Only the open row's inputs exist in the DOM, and expanding is a re-render — so `mpCapture()` banks
the open charge into `this._mpDraft` before every toggle and tab change, the render reads the
draft back, and `mktPricingSave` merges it. Without that, collapsing a row would discard it.

**Charge ids restart at 1 on every property**, so the draft is stamped with `this._mpDraftProp` and
thrown away the moment the property changes. Without that stamp one property's typing shows up on
another's rows, which reads as a charge whose badge says complete over fields that look empty.

The **Charges overlay carries none of it**: no Marketing Details section on the charge form, no
Marketing Name / Listing Ready / requirement / category columns, no Group by Requirement, no
completeness banner (`mitsBanner` returns ''), and Bulk Update is General-only. **Preview
Pricing** moved to the Pricing tab too — General's Listing Details carries no pricing callout —
and the kebab's Pricing Setup link is gone.

## Test feature states

The Test Feature State selector shows by default while the prototype is being worked on; hide it
for a walkthrough by clicking the logo, or start hidden with `?test=0`. **Happy Path** is the default and the one used for walkthroughs: four properties, all
marketed online, three with every marketing detail in place and waiting to convert, Riverview
Apartments still missing details on all five of its charges.
